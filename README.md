#this development is made in LDPlayer 9 emulator, for Rise of Kingdoms game. Is a personal and for fun project. This will be made in Visual Studio Code with C# as the main (or only) languaje program. I'll be using Tesseract for OCR detection. LDPlayer 1280x720 / 240 DPI



1.-Clear UI (should have buttons to play or pause the bot. Also the option to enable or disable a function, for example I want to have helps running but nothing else.)



2.-Clear logs with timestamps to "remember" if bot pauses, closes or stop for any reason.



3.-Helps running



4.-Automatic Daily Task like VIP, rewards, quest, etc.



5.-Action Points never at max.



6.-Always tech upgrading on academy.



7.-Always building upgrading.



8.-Always training most high available troop (except for siege)



9.-Automatic fog exploration.



10.-Automatic cave exploration.



11.-AFK gathering node resources.



12.-AFK Barbs.



13.-AFK Forts.



MUST: Every function must be isolated so user decide what part of the bot is running.



Optional: AFK tutorial.

Optional: AFK gem farm
